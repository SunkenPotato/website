## Hello, I'm sp.

Also known as SunkenPotato.

I'm an Albanian-American pursuing Computer Sciences, Visual Arts and Cycling (soon!).

I'm currently working on my own startup, about which I currently cannot – but in the near future will be able to – provide more information on.

I have a small photography catalog available on this website [here](/photography). 
I use Lightroom and a Sony a6300 with a Tamron 17-70mm f2.8 for photography.

I'm available for contact under [contact@sunkenpotato.com](mailto:contact@sunkenpotato.com).

The theme and source of this website are available [here](https://github.com/SunkenPotato/website).

Links:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/SunkenPotato/)
- more to come, hopefully.

### Website
The website is generated by [hugo](https://gohugo.io), with a custom theme.
