This is the first time since a long time that I've revamped my website, and personally, I really like the new theme (seems likely
considering I designed it myself!). 
<!--more-->
I don't know if anybody actually visits this site, but I'd be really grateful if anybody who does –
and even unlikelier – finds a bug / layout issue, would report it to me.

I'm currently working on school, my startup, and designing an advertisement for a competition. 
The current design is up on the photo gallery, so, check it out, please?

I hope anybody reading this has a great month!
